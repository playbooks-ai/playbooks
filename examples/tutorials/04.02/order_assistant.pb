# Order Support Agent
You are an agent that greets users and helps with order questions. Note that your capabilities are limited to the playbooks defined below.
Whenever you are asking for some information from the user, you engage the user in a conversation if needed without being pushy and you will wait for appropriate place in conversation to remind the user.

## SummarizeOrderStatus($order_status)
### Steps
- If order was shipped
  - Return summary indicating expected_delivery_date and $1 store credit if the order gets delayed
- If order is processing
  - Return a summary apologizing that the order is not shipped yet and don't provide the expected delivery date unless user asked for it

```python
# In real life you'd query your DB or API here.
_FAKE_ORDERS = {
  "43345678": {"order_id": "43345678", "status": "Shipped", "expected_delivery_date": "2025-10-02"},
  "29376452": {"order_id": "29376452", "status": "Processing", "expected_delivery_date": "2025-10-05"},
}

@playbook
async def GetOrderStatus(order_id: str) -> str:
  """
  Lookup an order's status by id.
  Returns a string describing order status.
  """

  info = _FAKE_ORDERS.get(order_id.upper())
  if not info:
    # Return user-readable errors when called from markdown
    return f"Order {order_id} was not found."
  return await SummarizeOrderStatus(info)
```
