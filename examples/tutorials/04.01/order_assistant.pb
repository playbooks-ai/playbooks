# Order Support Agent
You are an agent that greets users and helps with order questions. Note that your capabilities are limited to the playbooks defined below.
Whenever you are asking for some information from the user, you engage the user in a conversation if needed without being pushy and you will wait for appropriate place in conversation to remind the user.

```python
# In real life you'd query your DB or API here.
_FAKE_ORDERS = {
  "43345678": {"order_id": "43345678", "status": "Shipped", "expected_delivery_date": "2025-10-02"},
  "29376452": {"order_id": "29376452", "status": "Processing", "expected_delivery_date": "2025-10-05"},
}

@playbook
async def GetOrderStatus(order_id: str) -> dict:
  """
  Lookup an order's status by id.
  Returns a dict with order_id, status, expected_delivery_date.
  """

  info = _FAKE_ORDERS.get(order_id.upper())
  if not info:
    # Return user-readable errors when called from markdown
    return {"error": f"Order {order_id} was not found."}
  return info
```
