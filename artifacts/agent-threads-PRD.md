# Agent Threading Architecture - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the transition from the current async-based agent architecture to a **thread-per-agent model with async I/O within each agent**. This change will enable distributed agent deployment, simplify the mental model, and improve fault isolation while maintaining performance for I/O-bound operations.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture (Async-Based)
- **Centralized event loop** coordinating all agents
- **Complex async inbox management** with waiting modes and timeouts
- **Shared meeting state** managed at program level
- **Tightly coupled agent coordination** through async/await patterns

### Recent Achievements
- ‚úÖ **Reorganized meeting system** into clean modular classes in `src/playbooks/meetings/`
- ‚úÖ **All 11 meeting tests passing** with progressive complexity
- ‚úÖ **Working tic-tac-toe game** demonstrating full meeting functionality
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated new/old system terminology** for cleaner codebase

## Target Architecture (Thread-Per-Agent)

### Core Principles
1. **One thread per agent** with independent execution
2. **Async I/O within each agent** for LLM calls, APIs, etc.
3. **Decentralized state management** - each agent maintains its own view
4. **Message-based communication** via thread-safe queues
5. **Distributed-ready design** for multi-machine deployment

### Key Architectural Changes

#### Agent Structure
```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str):
        self.message_queue = queue.Queue()  # Thread-safe
        self.thread = None
        self.running = False
        self.meeting_views = {}  # Own meeting state
        
    def start(self):
        self.running = True
        self.thread = threading.Thread(target=self.main_loop)
        self.thread.start()
    
    def main_loop(self):
        # Create async loop for this thread
        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
        
        while self.running:
            try:
                message = self.message_queue.get(timeout=0.1)
                if message:
                    loop.run_until_complete(self.process_message(message))
            except queue.Empty:
                continue  # Keep polling
    
    async def process_message(self, message):
        # Can still await LLM calls, API calls, etc.
        response = await self.llm_call(...)
```

#### Simplified Program State
```python
class Program:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents_lock = threading.RLock()
        self.agents_by_id = {}  # Only shared state needed
        # No shared meeting state - each agent manages its own!
```

## Benefits Analysis

## Change Management Strategy

### Git Branching Approach
```bash
# 1. Commit current meeting work
git add .
git commit -m "Complete meetings system reorganization with working tests

- Consolidated meeting functionality into src/playbooks/meetings/
- 11/11 meeting tests passing including tic-tac-toe game
- Clean separation: Meeting, MeetingManager, MeetingMessageHandler, MeetingRegistry
- Removed new/old system terminology
- Ready for threading architecture transition"

# 2. Create threading branch
git checkout -b feature/agent-threading

# 3. Implement Phases 1-5 with incremental commits

# 4. Merge back when complete
git checkout meetings  # or master
git merge feature/agent-threading
```

### Risk Mitigation
- **Preserve Meeting Investment**: All meeting test logic remains valid
- **Incremental Validation**: Each phase has clear success criteria
- **Fallback Strategy**: Can return to async branch if needed
- **Integration Testing**: Meeting functionality serves as threading validation

### Success Criteria for Merge
1. **All 11 meeting tests pass** in threaded model
2. **Tic-tac-toe game works** with threaded agents
3. **Performance is acceptable** (no significant degradation)
4. **Architecture is distributed-ready** (network abstraction in place)
5. **Error handling is robust** (agent failures handled gracefully)

## Technical Architecture Details

### Thread Lifecycle Management
```python
class AgentThreadManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}
        self.shutdown_event = threading.Event()
    
    def start_agent(self, agent):
        agent.start()
        self.agents[agent.id] = agent
    
    def shutdown_all(self):
        self.shutdown_event.set()
        for agent in self.agents.values():
            agent.stop()
            agent.thread.join(timeout=5.0)
```

### Message Transport Abstraction
```python
class MessageTransport:
    def send_message(self, sender_id: str, target_id: str, message: dict):
        """Abstract interface for message delivery"""
        pass

class LocalQueueTransport(MessageTransport):
    """Local thread-safe queue implementation"""
    pass

class NetworkTransport(MessageTransport):
    """Network-based message delivery for distributed agents"""
    pass
```

### Decentralized Meeting State
```python
class AgentMeetingView:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.meetings = {}  # meeting_id -> MeetingView
    
    def update_meeting_participants(self, meeting_id: str, participants: List[str]):
        """Update local view of meeting participants"""
        # Eventually consistent - may differ between agents temporarily
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- **Thread overhead**: ~8MB per agent thread
- **Queue memory**: Bounded message queues to prevent memory leaks
- **Realistic scale**: 10-100 agents per machine

### CPU Usage
- **Context switching**: Minimal impact due to I/O-bound workloads
- **Async within thread**: Maintains efficiency for LLM calls
- **Message processing**: Simple queue operations are very fast

### Network Bandwidth (Future)
- **Message serialization**: JSON or Protocol Buffers
- **Compression**: For large messages between distributed agents
- **Batching**: Group small messages for efficiency

## Conclusion

The transition to a thread-per-agent architecture will significantly simplify the system's mental model while preparing it for distributed deployment. By maintaining async I/O within each agent thread, we preserve performance benefits while gaining the isolation and scalability advantages of threading.

The existing meeting system serves as an excellent integration test for this architecture change, ensuring that our threading implementation maintains all current functionality while opening the door to distributed multi-agent systems.

**Next Steps**: Implement this plan incrementally, using the meeting test suite as validation criteria for each phase of the threading transition.
