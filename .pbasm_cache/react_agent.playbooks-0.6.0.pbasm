# ReactAgent
This agent follows a reactive pattern to complete tasks by iteratively analyzing, acting, and evaluating until exit conditions are met.

## ReactSteps($task:str) -> str
Executes a task using a reactive approach with continuous evaluation and adaptation.
### Steps
- 01:TNK Think deeply about the $task to understand requirements
- 02:EXE Write down $exit_conditions:str for the task
- 03:CND While $exit_conditions are not met
  - 03.01:EXE Analyze current state and progress
  - 03.02:EXE Decide what action to take next
  - 03.03:EXE Execute the action (tool call, user interaction, computation)
  - 03.04:EXE Evaluate results against exit conditions
  - 03.05:JMP 03
- 04:EXE Analyze current state and progress
- 05:EXE Decide what action to take next
- 06:EXE Execute the action (tool call, user interaction, computation)
- 07:EXE Evaluate results against exit conditions
- 08:RET final results
