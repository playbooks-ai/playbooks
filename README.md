  <h2 align="center">Train AI Agents with Human Readable Playbooks</h2>
</div>

Playbooks AI‚Ñ¢ is a framework for creating AI agents using human-readable and LLM-executed playbooks. It uses a patent-pending natural language program execution engine.

**Status**: Playbooks AI is still in early development. It is not yet ready for production use. We are working hard and would love to get your feedback and contributions.

## Show me!

Let‚Äôs start simple. Here‚Äôs a Hello World AI agent written in Playbooks AI:

```playbooks
# Hello World Agent

## HelloWorldPlaybook

### Trigger
At the beginning of a conversation

### Steps
- Greet the user with a friendly "Hello, World!" message.
```

Simple, right? Just plain English defining AI behavior, no code required.

Now, let‚Äôs take it further. Imagine building a real-world AI agent that:

- Uses web search when needed
- Performs iterative deep research to gather and present information
- Rejects unsavory conversation topics

See [Playbooks AI implementation](examples/playbooks/web_search_chat.md) of a Web Search Chat agent ‚Äî about **50 lines of English instructions**. This agent:

- uses external tools
- implements an iterative, complex RAG flow
- demonstrates parallel tool calling
- demonstrates trigger-driven playbook execution

Now compare that with an equivalent [LangGraph implementation](examples/langgraph/web_search_chat.py) ‚Äî about **200 lines of complex code** that is hard to understand and modify, and yet, the resulting agent behavior is less flexible than the Playbooks AI agent!

## Why Playbooks?

Ever tried configuring an AI agent and thought, *"This is way harder than it should be"*? You‚Äôre not alone.

Building AI agents today requires choosing between **three frustrating options**:
1. **Code-based frameworks** (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.) ‚Üí Powerful but require deep technical expertise.
2. **No-code UI-based agent builders** (Voiceflow, Botpress, Vertex AI, Copilot Studio, Kore.ai, etc.) ‚Üí Easy to start but quickly become a tangled mess.
3. **Direct prompting** (Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, Tree-of-Thoughts, etc.) ‚Üí Seem intuitive but resulting behavior is unpredictable and brittle.

We thought: *Why not train AI agents like we train human agents?* 

Imagine **onboarding** a customer support agent. Instead of writing thousands of lines of Python or dragging boxes in a UI, **you give them playbooks** to follow ‚Äî structured, human-readable guides that include step-by-step procedures, caveats, and tips & tricks. What if you could do the same for onboarding an AI agent? **Now you can do that with Playbooks AI.** 

‚úÖ **Define AI behavior in plain English**  
‚úÖ Business users can read, modify, and adapt workflows  
‚úÖ Handles step-by-step execution, external API calls, and multi-agent collaboration  

Think of it as writing pseudocode that actually runs ‚Äî without complex state machines or hidden LLM hallucinations.

### **Playbooks AI vs. other approaches for building AI agents**

| Feature                 | **Playbooks AI** üèÜ | **Code-Based Frameworks** | **UI-Based Agent builders** | **Direct Prompting** |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**         | ‚úÖ Simple, human-readable playbooks | ‚ùå Requires Python & async expertise | ‚úÖ No-code UI, but complex flows are hard to maintain | ‚úÖ Easiest ‚Äî just type a prompt |
| **Behavior Tunability** | ‚úÖ Easily modify agent behavior | ‚ùå Requires coding expertise to modify | ‚ùå Hard to translate requirements into UI workflows | ‚ùå Difficult to get the right behavior |
| **Workflow Complexity** | ‚úÖ Handles simple & complex logic | ‚úÖ Handles complex logic, but requires coding expertise | ‚ùå Hard to scale beyond simple workflows | ‚ùå No structured execution, LLM follows instructions loosely |
| **External API Calls**  | ‚úÖ Simple, declarative tool calling | ‚úÖ Explicit tool calling | ‚úÖ Often requires prebuilt integrations | ‚ùå Needs manual copy-pasting of results, no automation |
| **Workflow Scalability** | ‚úÖ Designed to handle 100s-1000s of playbooks | ‚úÖ No limit, but code complexity grows exponentially | ‚ùå UI-based logic becomes unmanageable for large workflows | ‚ùå Cannot scale beyond one-off conversations |
| **Business User Usability**     | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No, complex code | ‚ùå No, complex workflow graphs | ‚ùå No, complex prompt engineering |

## Features

### Anyone can build AI agents with playbooks
- Write AI agent behavior using natural language playbooks instead of using code or using a UI builder
- Non-technical business users can understand and modify agent behavior as business realities change
- Talk with a copilot to modify playbooks and review changes

### Powerful agentic behavior
- Playbooks AI agents faithfully follow your instructions, overcoming LLM limitations
- Build complex agent behavior using 100s or 1000s of playbooks
- Easy to create multi-agent systems
- Easy to call external tools
- Magical dynamic triggering of playbooks to handle validations, caveats, special cases, and so on
- External event triggered playbooks

### Infinite possibilities

- Playbooks AI agent can be used to build agentic AI applications like:
  - Chatbots
  - Customer support agents
  - Virtual assistants
  - Virtual team members
  - Intelligent workflow automation
- Easy to use for simple and complex use cases, both standalone and integrated with other systems
