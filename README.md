  <h2 align="center">Train AI Agents with Human Readable Playbooks</h2>
</div>

Playbooks AI‚Ñ¢ is a framework for creating AI agents using human-readable and LLM-executed playbooks. It uses a patent-pending natural language program execution engine.

**Status**: Playbooks AI is still in early development. It is not yet ready for production use. We are working hard and would love to get your feedback and contributions.

## Show me!

Well, here is a hello world agent that uses a single playbook:

```playbooks
# Hello World Agent

## HelloWorldPlaybook

### Trigger
At the beginning of a conversation

### Steps
- Greet the user with a friendly "Hello, World!" message.
```

Simple, right?

Now a more complex example. Let's see how to create a safe, comprehensive web search chat agent that:

- uses external tools
- implements an iterative, complex RAG flow
- uses a few playbooks
- demonstrates parallel tool calling
- demonstrates trigger-driven playbook execution

See the [Web Search Chat](examples/playbooks/web_search_chat.md) Playbooks AI agent.

Now, take a look at the equivalent LangGraph implementation: [LangGraph implementation](examples/langgraph/web_search_chat.py). Crazy, right? And despite the highly complex implementation, it is still more [rigid and brittle](examples/langgraph/web_search_chat.md) compared to the Playbooks AI agent!

I'll offer a few refinements to make the content even more impactful while maintaining its flow:

## Why Playbooks? ü§î

It all started with a simple question - Why can't we train AI agents the same way we train human agents? Think about how a customer support agent learns: they get documentation covering common scenarios, tips and tricks gained from experience, and specific playbooks to follow (like "when a customer reports a billing issue, first verify their account details, then..."). These playbooks guide them while leaving room for judgment. Shouldn't AI agents be trained the same way?

One of the biggest headaches in working with AI agents today is getting them to behave exactly the way we want. Here's the problem:
- If you configure agents with code, business users can't understand the expected behavior, let alone make changes as business needs evolve. Current AI agent frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, and CrewAI require writing complex Python code with deep knowledge of async programming, state machines, and prompt engineering. Even experienced developers need significant time to understand and modify agent behavior.
- If you use a UI-based workflow automation or AI agent builder system, the initial simplicity is deceiving. Real-world workflows quickly turn into complex, jumbled graphs that are a nightmare to build, understand, and maintain. Companies spend months building these workflow graphs only to discover they need highly skilled specialists just to make simple changes.
- If you try implementing workflows using complex step-by-step prompts that look like playbooks, well... LLMs aren't great at following those faithfully. You'll get unreliable, incomplete, and sometimes hallucinated behavior.

Can't use code, can't use UIs, can't use complex prompts - now what? ü§∑

We need something that's:
- Easy to understand and modify ‚úçÔ∏è
- Leverages LLMs' smart decision-making abilities üß†
- Actually ensures your workflow instructions are followed ‚úÖ

That's where Playbooks AI comes in! Think of it as writing agent behavior in English-like pseudocode. The framework handles all the complex stuff behind the scenes:
- Proper step-by-step control flow
- Calling external tools and APIs at the right time
- Managing complex behaviors across hundreds or thousands of playbooks
- System complexities like multi-agent communication
- External event-triggered behaviors

But here's the best part: business users can actually read and understand playbooks. They also get a copilot that can transparently modify playbooks on their behalf. Need to add caveats? Special cases? New business logic? No problem! The copilot helps make those changes and presents them for your approval. üéØ

The result? A practical middle ground that makes powerful AI agents truly accessible and customizable for enterprise use. üöÄ

## Features

### Anyone can build AI agents with playbooks
- Write AI agent behavior using natural language playbooks instead of using code or using a UI builder
- Non-technical business users can understand and modify agent behavior as business realities change
- Talk with a copilot to modify playbooks and review changes

### Powerful agentic behavior
- Playbooks AI agents faithfully follow your instructions, overcoming LLM limitations
- Build complex agent behavior using 100s or 1000s of playbooks
- Easy to create multi-agent systems
- Easy to call external tools
- Magical dynamic triggering of playbooks to handle validations, caveats, special cases, and so on
- External event triggered playbooks

### Infinite possibilities

- Playbooks AI agent can be used to build agentic AI applications like:
  - Chatbots
  - Customer support agents
  - Virtual assistants
  - Virtual team members
  - Intelligent workflow automation
- Easy to use for simple and complex use cases, both standalone and integrated with other systems
