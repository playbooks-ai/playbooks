In the time before memory, when the crystal storms still sang across the methane seas of Kythara, three species held the world in balance. The Lumenweavers, beings of pure bioluminescent filaments who drifted through the upper atmosphere, filtered the harsh radiation of the triple suns into gentle colors that painted the sky. Below them, the Resonance Colonies—vast networks of silicon-based organisms that grew like living mountains—absorbed these filtered lights and hummed with deep frequencies that cracked open the planet's crust, releasing the precious vapor-nutrients from the core. And in the depths of the vapor forests, the Void Dancers—shapeless entities of dark matter and probability—consumed the excess nutrients and excreted the quantum spores that would rise to feed the Lumenweavers above. But when the youngest Voidling grew too greedy and devoured more than its share, the chain shattered: the Lumenweavers dimmed, the Resonance Colonies fell silent, and the world grew cold. Only when the elder Void Dancers sacrificed their own mass to restore the balance did the great cycle resume, teaching all who came after that in the web of existence, the hunger of one could mean the starvation of all.
